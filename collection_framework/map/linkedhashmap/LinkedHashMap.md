# LinkedHashMap (Child of HashMap)

* It also has Node which also implements Map.Entry.
* It maintains insertion order by default.
* It can also remember last access.

# TODO: This is a very important concenpt so also learn its internal working and calculate its time complexity

This class is a subclass of HashMap class.

* The elements of LinkedHashMap are ordered.
* By default entries of LinkedHashMap are in key insertion order i.e. order in which the keys are inserted in the Map.
* However, LinkedHashMap can also maintain its elements in access order, i.e. order in which its entries are accessed from most recently accessed.
